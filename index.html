    <h1>Michael Jordan</h1>
    <p>Michael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time. Born on February 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Wilmington, North Carolina, Jordan revolutionized the sport with his extraordinary athleticism, competitive drive, and unmatched ability to perform in clutch moments.

        Jordan's career highlights include six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, five MVP awards, and ten scoring titles. Known for his time with the Bulls in the 1990s, Jordan led the team to two separate "three-peats" (1991–1993 and 1996–1998), cementing his legacy as a dominant force. His combination of skill, charisma, and relentless work ethic turned him into a global icon, transcending basketball.</p>
